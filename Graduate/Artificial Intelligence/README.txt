**Abstractâ€”** Identifying digits is a simple task for a human even with the varying amounts of nuances a digit can have. However, a
computer can have difficulty with this task, but can drastically decrease the amount of time it takes to do so compared to a 
human. Therefore, this paper attempts to categorize handwritten digits using clustering and artificial neural network 
methods. There are three main sections. First an explanation of the algorithms that are used, that include DBSCAN, k-means, 
and neural networks. Followed by a description of the MNIST dataset and how the dataset will be preprocessed before being used 
by the above algorithms. Finally, a discussion of how each algorithm was implemented and performed that is accompanied by 
plots and/or accuracy score. It is concluded that k-means and neural networks are reasonable choices for categorizing handwritten 
digits.

**Improvements**
- User image input to guess digit
- Testing digit strings
- Testing using other methods
